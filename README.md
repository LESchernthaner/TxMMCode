2. Preprocessing is performed on the main dataset with ``DataPreProcessing.py``
3. Topic models with different amounts of topics are trained with ``TrainDTM.py``
4. The resulting models and their internal structures are studied and visualised with ``Results.py``
5. Finally, the validation dataset is preprocessed and analysed with ``Validation.py``
